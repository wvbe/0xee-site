Communication & Multimedia Design alumnus at the Hague University. Entrepreneuring as freelance webdeveloper (x-54.com) since '11 and joined the team at Liones in early '13.

Currently interested in the MEAN stack and related techniques, has proficiency in front- and back-end Javascript (node, angular and plain js, little love for jquery), PHP, Processing, HMTL/CSS/related (I guess you can count in Jade and SASS/SCSS), illustration, the Adobe suite, 3DS Max and basic system administration (Linux).

I enjoy hacking and knitting parts of the internet together in order to make something unpredictable. I like to make predictable stuff too, but that is less of a hack and more of a science (proud member of the [FontoXML team](http://www.fontoxml.com)).

# Contact
My email address is all over the site (wybe@x-54.com), but in case you like to contact me over a social network that I'm already on, please mention that you managed to get this far (using this site, I mean).

@TODO: make a list of social networks that Im on, as a workaround you can just google "[wybe minnebo](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=wybe+minnebo)".
