# "WTF" page for 0x.ee
You have come to this page because you had no idea what is going on. Or you were just running the "wtf" command for fun. No reason to be ashamed.

## What is 0x.ee?
0x.ee is the portfolio site of Wybe Minnebo. It is also the shortest domain name he could get his hands on. It is the hexidecimal code for 238, the color #eeeeee (three times 0xEE) is short for rgb(238, 238, 238), a very light and subtle shade of gray.

Though the interface may look intimidating (see also "Why does 0x.ee work this way?"), there is nothing on this site that can harm your computer.

## Why does 0x.ee work this way?
Because it's kinda cool, right? The way it works - through command line input - is pretty straightforward in an old-fashioned way, but very powerful. The best software today is still handled through terminals. Because 0x.ee is also a "webpage", it has loads of interactivity added on top of a regular terminal. There are words or phrases that you can click, content may open in seperate windows, and true fanatics can simply bookmark their text input so it is replayed next time you visit (or share).
